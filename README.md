# Brob
**Br**awler with Bl**ob**s.

Created during [a Gamejam](https://www.ifsr.de/fsr:news:27.10._gamejam), add tomato sauce to codebase to use as meal.

## Build
Open With [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

## Play
Use 1 controller + keyboard or 2 controllers.  
Will potentially document rules later.

## Bugs
Plenty are in there. If you really care, file a bug report.

## Multiplayer
Was planned, didn't work. Broken server inside dir `srv`.

## Screenshots
Do I look like I'd bother w/ screenshots during a gamejam?
